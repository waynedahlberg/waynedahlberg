# Fast Times on Shoreline Drive

This is our first blog post. It's a bit of a work in progress, but we're getting there.

Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) was a high-performance computing manufacturer that rose to prominence in the 1990s. The company was founded in 1981 by Jim Clark, a professor at Stanford University, and several of his graduate students. SGI's workstations and servers were known for their advanced graphics capabilities, which made them popular in industries such as film, video games, and scientific research.

In the mid-1990s, SGI's workstations were used to create the groundbreaking special effects in movies like "Jurassic Park" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". The company's servers were also used in scientific research, including the study of the human genome.
However, SGI's fortunes began to decline in the late 1990s. The company faced increasing competition from other high-performance computing manufacturers, such as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. SGI also struggled to adapt to the changing technology landscape, particularly the rise of commodity hardware and the open-source software movement.

In 2006, SGI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, but it was a shadow of its former self. In 2016, SGI was acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $275 million. The SGI brand was retired in 2017, and its products were integrated into HPE's high-performance computing division.
