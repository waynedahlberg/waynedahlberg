# Hello, I'm Wayne
### Product designer, builder

I enjoy the gap between design and development, building digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. 

## ðŸ›  Design Stack
- **Figma**: wireframing, user-flows, screen design, static prototyping
- **SwiftUI**: live SwiftUI prototyping for native interactions, device capabilities
- **React/Next**: web design, layout, and live prototyping

## ðŸ’¡ What I Do
- Transform designs into live code prototypes
- Build intuitive user interfaces with SwiftUI
- Create responsive web pages using React
- Prototype and iterate on product ideas
- Bridge the gap between design and development teams

*"Code is the highest fidelity of software design." - Me*
